ESFJ-A Consult (People who share the Consul personality type are, for lack of a better word, popular â€“ which makes sense, given that it is also a very common personality type, making up twelve percent of the population. In high school, Consuls are the cheerleaders and the quarterbacks, setting the tone, taking the spotlight and leading their teams forward to victory and fame.
